    <h1>Hummus</h1>
    <img src="hummus.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Hummus is a classic for a reason. This is a go-to hummus recipe. It's a great spread for sandwiches, wraps, and
        crackers. It's a phenomenal dip for veggies. It can be used as a base for pasta sauces and salad dressings, and
        it can be dolloped onto nourish bowls. Is there anything it can't do?
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups (246 g) cooked chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 ml) tahini</li>
        <li>1 tsbp (15 ml) extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) ice water</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all of the ingredients, except for the water, to a food processor and blend on high until smooth.</li>
        <li>While the mixture is blending, in a thin and steady stream, add half of the ice water to the food
            processor*. If desired, skip this step by simply adding the water in with the ingredients in step #1.</li>
        <li>Taste test the hummus. If too thick, add the remaining water. For a creamier consistency, add more olive oil
            and/or tahini. For more zest, add more lemon juice. Plate, garnish, and serve!</li>
    </ol>
