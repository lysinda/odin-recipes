    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <h3>Bolognese sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a non-stick pan and fry the vegan ground beef according to package directions
            until crumbly. Then set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large deep pan or pot. Add the onions, carrots and celery and sauté for 2-3
            minutes until the onions are translucent. Then add the garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Next, add tomato
            paste and Italian herbs and sauté for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Now stir in the vegan ground beef. Then deglaze with red wine and let it boil down briefly. Now stir in
            strained and chopped tomatoes, season with a little salt and pepper and simmer the Bolognese sauce for about
            15 minutes with a lid on it until it has thickened well. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed and allow to
            cool slightly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Béchamel sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the vegan butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Then whisk in the flour and sweat for 1 minute,
            stirring constantly. Now slowly add the soy milk and bring to a boil, continuing to stir until the sauce
            thickens. Season to taste with salt, pepper, nutmeg and nutritional yeast flakes. Then remove from heat and
            set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Layer the lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 392 °F (200 °C). Brush a baking dish with a little oil.</li>
        <li>First spread a thin layer of Bolognese sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Then alternate layers of
            lasagna sheets, bolognese and béchamel on top. Finish with a thick layer of béchamel sauce. Finally,
            sprinkle with some vegan grated cheese and/or vegan Parmesan and bake the lasagna for about 45 minutes in
            the preheated oven (if the top browns too quickly, you can cover it with parchment paper or aluminum foil).
        </li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool down a bit while it becomes more sliceable. Then garnish with fresh basil and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
